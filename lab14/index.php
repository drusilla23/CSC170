                    <h3>More about South Ayrshire</h3>
                    <p><p>Geographically, South Ayrshire is located on the western coast of Scotland, sharing borders with neighbouring local authorities East Ayrshire, Dumfries and Galloway and North Ayrshire. The climate in South Ayrshire, typical of that in Western Scotland, is milder than that of Eastern Scotland due to the stronger maritime influence, as the prevailing winds blow from into South Ayrshire, which is located primarily on the western coast of Scotland. </p></p>
